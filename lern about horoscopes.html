              <p>Cardinal signs are known for their initiative, leadership, and ability to start new things. They are
                proactive, assertive, and have a strong desire for action and progress. Cardinal signs are often seen as
                catalysts for change and are driven by a need to take charge and make things happen.</p>

              <video src="./video/Fixed.mp4" controls></video>
              <p>Fixed signs are characterized by their stability, determination, and perseverance. They have a strong
                sense of purpose and are known for their reliability and loyalty. Fixed signs are often resistant to
                change and prefer to establish a solid foundation before making any major adjustments. They are
                determined and focused on achieving their goals.</p>

              <video src="./video/Mutable.mp4" controls></video>
              <P>Mutable signs are adaptable, flexible, and open to change. They are known for their versatility and
                ability to go with the flow. Mutable signs are often curious and eager to explore new possibilities.
                They can easily adjust to different situations and are skilled at finding solutions to problems. Mutable
                signs are often associated with communication and are known for their ability to connect with others.

            <h1> The Competition between the Modalities</h1>
            <div>
              <img src="./img/comppition.png" alt="" srcset="">
              <p>The competition between the modalities in astrology—cardinal, fixed, and mutable—revolves around their
                distinct approaches and strengths. Cardinal signs strive to take the lead and initiate action, often
                competing for control and influence. Fixed signs, on the other hand, focus on stability and
                perseverance, sometimes competing to maintain their established positions. Mutable signs, known for
                adaptability and versatility, may face competition from the assertiveness of cardinal signs and the
                resistance to change from fixed signs. While competition exists, it's important to recognize the value
                of collaboration and understanding among the modalities, as they each contribute unique qualities that
                can lead to more balanced and successful outcomes.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>

            <p>These additional characteristics further highlight the unique qualities and strengths associated with
              each of the three modalities in astrology. Keep in mind that the qualities of an individual's sun sign
              (the zodiac sign determined by their birth date) are just one aspect of their astrological profile, and
              other factors such as the positions of other planets in their birth chart can also influence their
              personality traits.</p>

            <h1>Compatibility Between the Elements</h1>
            <video src="./video/Compatibility Between the Elements.mp4 Between the Elements.mp4" controls></video>
            <p>The compatibility between astrology elements reveals how different signs interact and connect. Signs of
              the same element tend to have an innate understanding and harmony. Fire signs ignite and energize each
              other, creating passionate and dynamic relationships. Earth signs offer stability and grounding, building
              practical and secure connections. Air signs stimulate each other intellectually, fostering communication
              and mental rapport. Water signs form deep emotional bonds, sharing intuitive and empathetic connections.
              While elemental compatibility is significant, individual personalities and other astrological factors also
              contribute to overall compatibility. Successful relationships require mutual respect, effective
              communication, and the willingness to embrace each other's differences.</p>

            <p>individuals express themselves, interact with others, and navigate their lives. However, it's important
              to remember that astrology is just one tool among many for self-reflection and understanding, and
              individual experiences may vary.</p>
