                                    prevent burnout, reduces stress levels, and promotes physical and mental health.

                                    with family, friends, and loved ones. Spending quality time with loved ones
                                    strengthens bonds, fosters emotional connections, and provides support networks. It

                                    they are more likely to be satisfied with their jobs. This, in turn, leads to higher

                                <p>It's important to recognize your limits and not overcommit yourself. Learn to say
                                    'no' to additional responsibilities or tasks that may overload your schedule. Set
                                    boundaries and learn to decline requests or delegate tasks when necessary.</p>

                                    work-life balance goals and challenges. Seek support from your loved ones and build
                                    a support network that can help you manage your responsibilities and provide
                                    guidance when needed.</p>

                                <p>Identify your most important tasks and focus on them first. Learn to delegate tasks
                                    that can be handled by others, whether at work or home. Delegating can help lighten
                                    your workload and create more time for personal activities and relaxation.</p>
